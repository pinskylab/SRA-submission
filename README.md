SRA Submission
==============
The repo provides information on how to upload files to NCBI's Sequence Read Archive. This is a key step to progressing the goal of open science and easy access to data. Please ensure this guide is up-to-date before use. All data described in this repo regarding *Amphiprion clarkii* was collected by the Pinsky lab group.

In the event that additional help is needed in the SRA submission process, the *National Library of Medicine* uploaded a helpful tutorial to YouTube.
