"Your table upload failed because multiple BioSamples cannot have identical attributes. You should have one BioSample for each specimen, and each of your BioSamples must have differentiating information (excluding sample name, title, bioproject accession and description). This check was implemented to encourage submitters to include distinguishing information in their samples. If the distinguishing information is in the sample name, title or description, please recode it into an appropriate attribute, either one of the predefined attributes or a custom attribute you define. If it is necessary to represent true biological replicates as separate BioSamples, you might add an 'aliquot' or 'replicate' attribute, e.g., 'replicate = biological replicate 1', as appropriate. Note that multiple assay types, e.g., RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data may reference the same BioSample if appropriate."
# To get past this, I am going to include ligation_id in sample name and also include a column called ligation_id (a custom attribute).

# Sending the bam files by FTP - COMPRESS Folder INTO TAR!!!
I logged into the FTP using Fetch following the onscreen instructions and started dragging over bam files.  
However, the bam.bai files are also intertwined, it was taking hours, and was timing out before completing all of the transfers.  
I copied all of the bam files into a bam files folder in the data > apcl > all_samples > 20181127 > bam\ files.  
Maybe I can separate them into folders on my end and then just drag and drop the folder for submission. The folder transfer will take hours but hopefully it won't time out.

# The file names don't match the metadata
hand edit the metadata table because it is just a few regenotypes


# The first submission is called SUB4607463
There is an error of undefined origin, waiting for an email response

# The second submission is called SUB6249894
- Mark no for biosample
- upload table_2 for biosample attributes
- transferring files starting 11:20am on Monday, 9-9-2019
